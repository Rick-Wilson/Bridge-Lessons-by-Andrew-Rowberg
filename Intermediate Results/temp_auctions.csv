1,"1C – 2H (1-4-4-4, 8+ HCP) – 2S (waiting) – 3C (11-13 HCP) – 3S (sets trump) – 4C (cue) – 4H (cue) – 4S",
2,"1C – 1NT (5+ C, GF) – 2C (waiting) – 2S (5332, non-min; start with 1S with 5min 332 and 8-10) – 2NT (waiting) – 3S (doubleton) – 4H (to play) – P (~13- HCP)",
3,"1C – 1H (5+ S, GF) – 2H (6+ H) – 3C (4-5 D) – 3H (sets suit) – 3S (cue) – 4D (cue) – 4S (H keycard) – 5C (3/0) – 5D (Q?) – 5NT (QH no other K) – 6H (probably too much to ask to get to 7; N would need to reveal shape more precisely)","Possible that N could bid 3D instead of 3H, which sets the suit and initiates cuebids"
4,"1C – 2NT (4-4-4-1, 8+ HCP) – 3C (waiting) – 3H (11-13 HCP) – 3NT (to play) or (less likely) 4D (relay) – 4H (forced) – 5D (to play)",
4-1,"1C – [1H] – X (takeout, GF) – [2H] – 3C – [P] – 3NT",Alternative
5,"1C – 1NT (5+ C GF) – 2S (usually 6+ spades) – 3C (4-5 D) – 3H (55 majors) – 4NT (no fit, 11-13) – 6NT",
6,"1C – 2D (5+ H, GF) – 2S (6+ spades) – 3D (6+ H) – 3H (set suit) – 3S (cue bid) – 4C (cue) – 4D (cue) – 4S (keycard) – 5NT (even w/ void) – 7H?",
7,"1C – 2C (5+ D, GF) – 2H (6+ hearts) – 2S (5332, non-min) – 3H (set suit) – 4D (cue) – 4S (keycard) – 5D (2 keycards, no QH) – 6H",
8,"1C – 3C (4-4-1-4, 8+ HCP) – 3D (waiting) – 3S (11-13 HCP) – 4C (relay) – 4D (forced) – 4H (nat slam try) – P",
9,"1C – 1H (5+ S, GF) – 2C (6+ C) – 2D (4-5 H) – 3C (set suit) – 3D (cue) – 3H (cue) – 3S (cue) – 4D (keycard) – 4NT (2 keycards, no QC) – 5D (kings?) – 5NT (no KH, no KS, yes KD) – 6NT",
10,"1C – 3C (4-4-1-4, 8+ HCP) – 3D (waiting) – 4C (16+ HCP) – 4NT (spade keycard) – 5D (3/0) – 5H (Q?) – 6S (QS, no other K’s) – P (probably)","I’ve never discussed this auction, because the 4C bid showing 16+ HCP is exceedingly rare. It stands to reason that the only permissible bids after that are looking for slams, so they should be keycard sequences for the usual mini-Roman relay"
11,Like #8,
12,"1C – 1H (5+ S, GF) – 1S (waiting) – 2H (6+ S) – 2S (set suit) – 3H (4 H – no cuebids below 3 of suit) – 3S (start cuebidding) – 4C (cue) – 4H (cue) – 4S (maybe?)",
13,"1C - 2NT (4-4-4-1, 8+ HCP) - 3C (waiting) - 3D (8-10 HCP) - 4D (relay) - 4H (forced) - 4S (to play)",
14,"1C - [1H] - 2H (4-1-4-4, GF) - [P] - 2NT (ask) - 3D (11-13 HCP) - 3NT (to play; maybe could sniff out 6D)","I’d expect W to raise to 3H instead of passing, in which case I don’t think N has an asking bid available. X would be penalty, 3S would set the suit, 3NT to play. 4-level bids sound like regular 3-suiter relays. Without interference, S would start with 3D to show 4-1-4-4 shape. Interestingly, interference helps save space here."
15,"1C - 2H (1-4-4-4, GF) - 2S (waiting) - 2NT (8-10 HCP) - relay to 4H or investigate slam, I guess, maybe bidding 3D/H to set suit and ask for cuebids",
16,"1C - 1H (5+ S, GF) - 2C (6+ C) - 3C (4-5 D) - 3NT (to play) - 4D (5 D, 5S, slammish) - 4NT/5D (to play)",
17,"1C - 1NT (5+ C, GF) - 2S (6+ S) - 3H (3+ card spade support or 2 spades w/ honor, nothing else to say regarding shape) - 3S (set suit) - cue bids and keycard to come, landing in 6S or 7S",
18,"1C - 2H (1-4-4-4, 8+ HCP – I’d vote for this even with the stiff AS) – 2S (waiting) – 3D (14-15 HCP) – 4C (relay) – 4D (forced) – 4NT (quantitative invite) – P? (4C and beyond is a bit speculative here, not sure how it would go at the table)",
19,"1C – 3C (4-4-1-4, 8+ HCP) – 3D (waiting) – 3NT (14-15 HCP) – 4NT? (spade keycard) – etc.",

21,1C – [2C] – P (not GF) – [2D] – X (takeout) – [3C] – 3H – [3S] – 4H – all pass,
22,"1C – 2C (5+ D, GF) – 2D (waiting) – 2H (4 S) – 3D (set suit) – 3S (cue) – 4D (denies club control) – 4H (D keycard) – 4NT (3/0) – 5C (Q?) – 5H (QD, KH) – 6C (ask for K) – 6D (nope) – 6NT?",Finding 7 may be too hard; requires knowing about QS. Maybe N should take control of auction with keycard 4H instead of bidding 4D.
23,"1C – 2NT (4-4-4-1, 8+) – 3C (waiting) – 3NT (16+ HCP) – 6NT (to play, expecting 16 HCP)",

25,"1C - 2D (5+ H, GF) - 2H (waiting) - 3C (4-5 card minor) - 4H (to play; probably too light for 3H and cuebidding)",
26,"1C – 3D (4-1-4-4, 8+) – 3H (waiting) – 3S (11-13 HCP) – 4C (relay) – 4D (forced) – 5D (slam invite)",
27,"1C – 2NT (4-4-4-1, 8+) – 3C (waiting) – 3D (8-10 HCP) – relay to 4H",
28,"1C – 2H (1-4-4-4, 8+; don’t lie about shape I guess) – 2S (waiting) – 2NT (8-10 HCP) – either 3NT or relay to 4H",

30-1,"1C – 1H (5+ S, GF) – 1S (waiting) – 2C (4-5 D) – 2S (sets suit) – 3C (likely a fragment 5-1-4-3 or 5-0-4-4) – 3S – 4D (cue) – 4NT etc",Without interference
31,"1C – 2D (5+ H, GF) – 2H (waiting, no 6-card suit) – 3D (6+ H) – 3S (5 S, probably skeptical of 3NT and 4H) – 3NT/4H",
32,"1C – 2H (1-4-4-4, 8+) – 2S (waiting) – 3D (14-15) – 3NT (or could relay to 5D)",
33,"1C – 1S (balanced, no 5-card suit, unless 8-10 and 5-card minor) – 1NT (stayman-like) – 2NT (4 C + another 4-card suit, 11-13 or 16+) – 3C (waiting) – 3D (4 H) – 3NT – P","would probably just raise to 3NT instead of 3C, but I wanted to show the full system. These 1S response hands should be coming up much more frequently…"
34,"1C – [3D?] – 3S (5+ H, GF) – [P] – 4H",

36,"1C – 1NT (5+ C, GF) – 2H (6+ H) – 2S (ostensibly 5332, but I think the assumption should be that N would go slow with 4 S. This hand is tough if S bids 3H, showing 4 S. Rule of thumb: don’t transfer over partner’s declared suit.) – 3H (sets suit) – 3S (cue) – 4C (cue) – 4D (cue) – 4S (H keycard) – 4NT (1/4) – 5S (K’s?) – 5NT (KS) – 7NT (since the KD is known)",
37,"1C – 2D (5+ H, GF) – 2S (6+ S; I think the suit is too good for agreeing to play H) – 3H (spade support; only other option would be 3S -> balanced hand) – 3S (sets suit) – 4C – 4D – 4H – 4NT (keycard) – 5H – 6S",

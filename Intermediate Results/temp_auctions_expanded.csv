Pass 6S (QS, no other K’s) Pass Pass (probably) Pass","I’ve never discussed this auction, because the 4C bid showing 16+ HCP is exceedingly rare. It stands to reason that the only permissible bids after that are looking for slams, so they should be keycard sequences for the usual mini-Roman relay"

X would be penalty, 3S would set the suit, 3NT to play. 4-level bids sound like regular 3-suiter relays. Without interference, S would start with 3D to show 4-1-4-4 shape. Interestingly, interference helps save space here."
